# {reply} / {trinity} / {train} Policy Loop Breakdown

## Purpose

This document turns the current cross-project direction into an exact repo-by-repo execution map.

The target loop is:

1. `{reply}` exports deterministic operator reality.
2. `{trinity}` owns live drafting and policy application.
3. `{train}` optimizes narrow behavior slices offline.
4. promotion back into `{trinity}` is explicit, versioned, replay-gated, and reversible.

This is not whole-brain training.
This is not direct `{reply}` optimization.
This is not autonomous runtime mutation.

## Current Boundary

- `{reply}` owns ingestion, operator workflow, send execution, and outcome capture.
- `{trinity}` owns live drafting runtime behavior.
- `{train}` owns bounded offline optimization only.

## Repo-By-Repo Issues

### `{reply}`

#### `REPLY-POLICY-001` Export contract hardening

Scope:
- keep `{reply}` as an exporter of runtime facts only
- stop any drift toward local learning logic

Deliver:
- deterministic `ThreadSnapshot` export from the live conversation path
- deterministic `DraftOutcomeEvent` export from operator actions
- explicit `contract_version` on every cross-repo payload

Acceptance:
- the same cycle exports the same payload from the same source state
- product-private local state is not dumped outside the bounded contract

#### `REPLY-POLICY-002` Active policy provenance emission

Scope:
- ensure every exported cycle identifies which `{trinity}` artifact version shaped runtime behavior

Deliver:
- include `accepted_artifact_version` or `accepted_policy_version` metadata in the trace/export handoff
- preserve `cycle_id`, `candidate_id`, `thread_ref`, `channel`, `outcome disposition`

Acceptance:
- every exported cycle can be replayed against the exact runtime artifact version used live

#### `REPLY-POLICY-003` Product gate separation

Scope:
- keep product and transport policy in `{reply}`, not in learned runtime artifacts

Must remain in `{reply}`:
- send gating
- human approval
- bridge-vs-native classification
- outbound verification
- transport/channel truth

Acceptance:
- behavior artifacts can shape draft behavior
- behavior artifacts cannot override transport or safety gates

#### `REPLY-POLICY-004` Training-bundle handoff shape

Scope:
- export only what `{train}` needs for offline bounded learning

Deliver:
- cycle trace reference
- selected candidate metadata
- final sent text
- edit-distance / rewrite severity
- latency
- channel and contact scope metadata

Acceptance:
- `{reply}` does not become a schema dumping ground for `{train}`

### `{trinity}`

#### `TRINITY-POLICY-001` `ReplyBehaviorPolicy` schema and validator

Scope:
- define the first bounded policy artifact family

Initial sections:
- `tone_preferences`
- `brevity_preferences`
- `channel_rules`

Initial scopes:
- `company`
- `global`
- `channel`

Out of scope initially:
- `thread_type`
- contact-specific policy
- hidden runtime heuristics

Acceptance:
- load/save/validate works
- invalid artifact is rejected
- precedence is deterministic

#### `TRINITY-POLICY-002` Accepted policy/artifact registry

Scope:
- track which accepted runtime artifact version was active for a cycle

Deliver:
- explicit accepted artifact registry
- immutable versions
- explicit promotion metadata
- explicit rollback metadata

Acceptance:
- one-step rollback
- no shared-write or hidden mutation path

#### `TRINITY-POLICY-003` Training bundle export

Scope:
- export bounded learning bundles from live cycles

Initial bundle types:
- `tone-learning`
- `brevity-learning`
- `channel-formatting-learning`

Acceptance:
- bundle generation is deterministic
- bundle links back to cycle/trace IDs
- bundle corpus is replayable offline

#### `TRINITY-POLICY-004` Runtime policy loader/resolver

Scope:
- apply accepted artifacts at runtime without collapsing policy and product ownership

Initial precedence:
1. `channel`
2. `global`

Initial runtime application points:
- generator prompt shaping
- refiner constraints
- evaluator hints
- ranking/strategy hints

Must not affect:
- send lifecycle semantics
- transport rules
- safety gates

Acceptance:
- traces show the artifact version applied
- runtime behavior changes are attributable

#### `TRINITY-POLICY-005` Acceptance gate workflow

Scope:
- promotion is a workflow, not a side effect

Gate:
1. schema validation
2. scope validation
3. replay on fixtures
4. compare against incumbent
5. reject on regression threshold
6. explicit promotion only

Acceptance:
- copy-forward promotion
- explicit rollback
- accepted artifacts are locally registered

### `{train}`

#### `TRAIN-POLICY-001` Training bundle loader

Scope:
- consume exported bounded learning bundles from `{trinity}`

Deliver:
- strict schema validation
- contract-version validation
- deterministic fixture loading

Acceptance:
- malformed bundles are rejected
- bundles can be replayed repeatedly with stable results

#### `TRAIN-POLICY-002` Tone learner

Scope:
- first narrow learner

Inputs:
- selected candidate
- final sent text
- rewrite severity
- channel

Output:
- candidate `ReplyBehaviorPolicy` proposal for tone

Acceptance:
- incumbent vs proposal comparison is reproducible

#### `TRAIN-POLICY-003` Brevity learner

Scope:
- reduce rewrite severity caused by length mismatch

Output:
- bounded brevity policy proposal

Acceptance:
- proposal improves rewrite severity or holdout quality without causing regressions

#### `TRAIN-POLICY-004` Channel formatting learner

Scope:
- learn bounded formatting expectations per channel

Examples:
- greeting shape
- link formatting
- attachment reference style
- newline density

Acceptance:
- output remains explicit policy, not opaque prompt drift

#### `TRAIN-POLICY-005` Proposal artifact and eval report

Scope:
- every training run produces:
  - proposed artifact
  - incumbent comparison
  - replay/eval report

Acceptance:
- results are versioned
- results are promotion-ready but never self-promoting

## Exact Schema List

Canonical schema ownership stays in `{trinity}`.

This repo currently carries local validation models for the exported Trinity contract surface.
Those models must stay aligned with the canonical exported contract, and the docs should not
pretend the schema catalog lives only in another repo today.

## Current Open-Source Reality

Today the shipped bounded lanes are:

- Reply behavior proposals for `tone`, `brevity`, and `channel-formatting`
- Spot review-policy proposals for the first review-policy slice

Current scope posture:

- Reply proposals can be `global`, `company`, or `channel` scoped
- Spot review-policy proposals are intentionally narrower and currently support only `company` and `global`

Canonical reference:
- `/Users/Shared/Projects/trinity/docs/POLICY_LOOP_REPO_BREAKDOWN.md`

`{train}`-specific contract responsibilities:
- validate `contract_version` on imported bundles and traces
- consume the canonical accepted artifact provenance already carried by `ranked_draft_set.accepted_artifact_version`
- reject malformed or non-replayable inputs rather than inferring missing runtime dimensions

## Recommended Order

1. freeze the current live seam
2. harden `{reply}` export contract
3. define `ReplyBehaviorPolicy` in `{trinity}`
4. add `TrainingBundle` export in `{trinity}`
5. build `{train}` tone learner first
6. add replay-based promotion gate
7. load accepted artifacts in `{trinity}`
8. expand later into ranking and strategy
